reads an integer from the keyboard into a variable called "age"
reads a string from the keyboard into a variable called "name"
assigns your "age" multiplied by "365" to an "age_in_days" variable

displays" name "  you are " age_in_days " days old" (where name and age_in_days are replaced by the values that were input/assigned)
